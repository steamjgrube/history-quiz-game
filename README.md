# history-quiz-game

# This game features 7 history related questions. You have 1 minute to answer them, with a 5 second penalty each time you get one wrong. 
# I was unable to get the questions to be randomly chosen so as of right now they run through in order
# Your final score is calculated by the time you have remaining on the clock at the end. So to get the highest score possible you need to answer quickly and accurately.
# I have included buttons to redirect to a highscores page, but as of right now the highscores page is incomplete
